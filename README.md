## My Project

I will be analyzing a heart failure dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) in R. 

In order to run the .Rmd file to analyze the data, navigate to your project folder on the command line.


Run the following command to see descriptions of each rule in the Makefile

```bash
make help
```


You will need to install some R packages which can be installed by running the following command

```bash
make install
```


## Execute the analysis

Run the following command in order to create the final report html document called "report.html"

``` bash
make report
```
